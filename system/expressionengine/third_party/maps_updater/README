# Contact Selector
This package was originally developed for use with an Expression Engine 2.0 system, however it is fully contained and only requires a few simple changes to be made in order to have proper functionality in any server environment.

## Required for Expression Engine:

 1. mcp.maps_updater.php
 2. mod.maps_updater.php
 3. upd.maps_updater.php

# Usage
Anything you need to know about using this tool can be found in this section.
## Config
Every variable needed by initialization is present in the `/views/config.php` file. This includes access to the database, paths to place files as well as variables used within the tool itself.
## Customization
You can customize the front-end visuals by opening the template `/contact_selector/contact_selector.html` and changing the CSS in the `<style>` tags. If you change this file in the module folder, `maps_updater/`, it will publish the changes to the set path in `/views/config.php`.

## Initialization
Lets get things started!
### Admin Tool((Back-end):
When using **Expression Engine** all you need to do is copy the folder `maps_updater/` into Expression Engines' `/third_party/` modules folder, install the module and open it. This will move all the files to the correct locations assuming the paths are correctly set in `/views/config.php`.
**For everything else**, place the `maps_updater/` folder within your CMS secured folders to prevent access from unauthorized individuals, and open the file `/views/index.php` and uncomment the two comment blocks marked as

> // Uncomment the following for use outside Expression Engine

 then run `/views/index.php` to start using the tool. Like before assuming the paths are correctly set in `/views/config.php` it will move the files to the correct locations and work as intended.

### Contact Selector(Front-end):

When using **Expression Engine** embed the template where you would like it to display with the following code:`{embed="includes/contact_selector"}`.
This embed code is setup to allow 5 different parameters which allow you to customize the output of the contacts, **these parameters are case sensitive**.
 - `... allow_region="true" ...}`
 - `... selection_type="All" ...}`

All three of the following must be present to work correctly.
- `... selection_location="United States" ...}`
- `... selection_category="Category 1" ...}`
- `... selection_product="Product 1" ...}`

Example of all 5

 - `{embed="includes/contact_selector" selection_type="All" allow_region="false" selection_location="United States" selection_category="Category 1" selection_product="Product 1"}`

**For everything else**, the conditions above are all defined at the top of the `/contact_selector/contact_selector.html` file and need to be set for the tool to work correctly.
