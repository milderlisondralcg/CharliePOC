<H2>Review of <EM>Stories of Jews for Jesus</EM><BR>Reviewed by Rachel Friedlander </H2>
<P>In the most comprehensive collection yet, Matt Sieger compiles 19 testimonies in <EM>Stories of Jews for Jesus</EM>. This colorful cast creates episodes of laughter and tears, comedy and tragedy, each with an inspirational ending. Although this multitude of testimonies creates an intimidating page count, the pick-and-choose buffet format allows for each chapter to stand on its own.</P>
<P>Between the pediatrician who survived the concentration camps of the Holocaust, the bodyguard who has protected Ariel Sharon, and the lawyer who won a Jews for Jesus case in the Supreme Court, readers will be both captivated and challenged. Instances of drug addiction, family separation, deaths and disease tarnish these shining accomplishments, creating testimonies that are accessible by every human, Jew and Gentile, believer and unbeliever.</P>
<P>Despite their impressive nature, these testimonies are not told in an auditorium. There is no aura of professional sterility. Instead of a podium dividing the reader from the writer, it is a coffee table. With each story, we are invited into the living room of the author to hear their personal triumphs and failures. This ""dear diary"" format of full disclosure allows readers to discover the emotions, motives and viewpoint behind the stories.</P>
<P>Although the cozy, living room-feel of the collection provides insight, this strength also proves to be a weakness. Much like the nostalgic relative, the occasional testimony becomes thick with fond memories, and teatime begins to run long.</P>
<P>In complementing contrast, three teaching sections provide a fruitful finale to the collection of accounts. The juxtaposition of personal testimony and scholarly considerations satisfy both the right and left-brain readers. The teachings, written by Efraim Goldstein, Gail Simonowitz, and Susan Perlman, address the chapter of Isaiah 53 and the identity and nature of the Messiah.</P>
<P>In addition to providing substantial grounding for the discoveries made in the testimonies, these teachings also create a skillful segue into the conclusion: a call for unbelievers to receive salvation. In the final words of his testimony, Tuvya Zaretsky encourages readers to set aside their fear and pick up the search, because ""Truth remains what it is, whether we choose to believe it or not.""</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>","Nineteen intimate, candid, first-hand accounts of Jews who believe in Jesus","Testimony, Jews for Jesus, coming to faith, lawyer, Holocaust survivor, Jesus, messiah, ",,,,,,,"2014-10-26 00:00:00","2019-11-30 00:00:00","2014-10-27 00:00:00",,"2014-10-27 00:00:00",,,0,false,true,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,511.0000,0.0000,0,1.0000,0.0000,true

<H2>Review of Walk With Yeshua Through the Jewish Year<BR>Reviewed by Rachel Friedlander</H2>
<P>Explaining complex religious theology or ancient rituals to six-year-olds can be a daunting task. Yet Janie-sue Wertheim and Kathy Shapiro team up to prove the seemingly insurmountable is possible in <EM>Walk with Yeshua Through the Jewish Year</EM>.</P>
<P>But this book does more than provide simplified descriptions and background information of fifteen holidays. It digs deeper, explores passages of relevant Scripture, explains Jewish traditions regularly observed for each holiday, and even provides fresh, creative ideas for celebration. Each section ends with a suggested Bible memory verse and a blank page for youngsters to create crayon masterpieces.</P>
<P>Even though it is aimed at children, this book does not speak down to its readers. The vocabulary may be simple, but the message is powerful. Even the recipes, picnics, prayers, and theatrical plays suggested have the ability to unify families and create new friendships. A well researched and carefully written book that helps children identify the Jewish roots of their faith and cherish it, year round.<BR></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>","For kids of all ages!","kids, children, jewish, holidays, Wertheim, Shapiro, activities, feasts, ",,,,,,,"2000-01-12 00:00:00","2000-01-12 00:00:00","2012-07-31 00:00:00","2013-01-01 00:00:00","2014-04-21 00:00:00",,,0,false,true,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,91.0000,0.0000,2,1.0000,0.0000,true

<P>Through a unique and rare exchange of letters, an evangelical preacher, R. T. Kendall, and a senior Jewish rabbi, David Rosen, openly discuss and debate their views on heaven and how we get there. This groundbreaking book offers an opportunity to read the heartfelt correspondence of these two prolific and acclaimed theologians as they vigorously defend their own beliefs while they challenge each other's claims. <BR><BR>Despite living in a time of tumultuous religious division, the two leaders develop a refreshing and deep mutual respect and forge a strong friendship through the questions asked and answered. As the men encounter seemingly irreconcilable differences in beliefs, THE CHRISTIAN AND THE PHARISEE shows how the little they do share allows them to form strong alliances-a lesson that is crucial to a world in crisis.</P>

<P class=textProdDetails></SPAN><SPAN class=textProdDetails>For Jon and Erin Bennett, the world seems to be spinning dangerously out of control. A new dictator is rising in Iraq. China is making threatening new moves toward Taiwan. North Korean forces appear ready to strike south. Israel is feverishly trying to complete the Third Temple. Oil prices are surging. And in the wake of a horrific war in the Middle East, President James MacPherson’s second term is coming to an end. Now the battle to succeed him is heating up into one of the most fiercely contested presidential elections in American history, and the Bennetts realize the stakes could not be higher. Who will lead a bitterly divided country over the next four years? What can the U.S. do to shape the new world order? And just what role--if any--does the U.S. play in the last days? As the presidential campaign narrows into a dead heat, the Secret Service learns of a catastrophic plot to assassinate one of the candidates--but which one, and can the terrorists be stopped in time?</SPAN><SPAN class=textProdDetails><SPAN class=textProdDetails></P>

The story begins in New Jersey and describes how the author's early exposure to Catholicism influenced her thinking and understanding of Christianity through out her childhood and adolescence. The narrative takes the reader on a spiritual journey across the country and through many of the experiences that characterized the 1960s. As the author describes her search for understanding, she deconstructs many of the misconceptions about Jesus and re-presents him as the Jewish Messiah. Sogolow offers a conservative, yet contemporary, view of Christianity, contrasting it with post modern views on religion and morality. This is a book that can correct misconceptions, break down barriers, and open the door for both Jews and Gentiles to embark upon a personal relationship with the Messiah.

Thirty years later, New York Times best-selling author Joel C. Rosenberg takes you inside the Revolution. He explains how it happened, how Washington missed it, and how Iran could soon bring the world to the brink of nuclear war. What’s more, Rosenberg argues there are now three revolutions in motion—not just one— each of which could change the Middle East and the world forever.

<H2><EM>PRAISE AND GLORY: The Songs of Jews for Jesus by Joshua 
Turnil</EM><BR><EM>Review by Rachel Friedlander</EM></H2>
<P>In his debut album, Joshua Turnil, the director of the Paris branch of Jews 
for Jesus, releases thirteen tracks of familiar songs with a fresh sound. Fellow 
musicians, including Jean Schwerzmann, Jacques Caruel, and Andreas Conzelmann, 
accompany with such instruments as accordion, violin, flutes, darbouka, oud, 
guitar, and piano. This impressive expression of talent allows the listener to 
travel the world in the span of thirteen tracks.</P>
<P>The danger of performing predominantly well-known music is failing to 
reinvent, fortunately Turnil quickly saves any lulls he creates. The album 
creates a smorgasbord of influences and styles, alternating between upbeat and 
slow tempos thus appealing to a wide range of tastes. Perhaps the best display 
of talent is the finale: the three hidden bonus tracks. In these last 
recordings, each of which are performed in French, Turnil truly stands out from 
the crowd. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>","Some old favorites with a smooth sound",,,,,,,,,,"2014-07-11 00:00:00",,"2014-07-11 00:00:00",,,0,false,true,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,452.0000,0.0000,2,1.0000,0.0000,true

<H2>Review of <EM>New Light Ruins Album: Coming Home</EM><BR>Reviewed by Rachel Friedlander </H2>
<P>New Light Ruins lays out the welcome mat with <EM>You Are Home</EM>, their second album release. In twelve original tracks, the trio, comprised of Remy Remigio, Sterling Reed, and Isaac Brickner, employ the sounds of drums, double bass, cello, trumpet, harmonica, and guitar. </P>
<P>The sounds of these tracks are not airbrushed, polished, and perfect, and what some may consider to be this album’s weakness may also be its greatest strength. Instead of a computer-generated masterpiece we hear the raw voice of three hearts. This intimate format is further bolstered by the album artwork—heartfelt notes and doodles cover every page. Clearly, every aspect of this project was covered in a personal touch, fueled by individual creative energy. Instead of the usual lyric-oatmeal that fills popular albums, these young men challenge listeners with compelling poetry. As the trio explains, each song is meant to explore an aspect of their worldwide travels, their spiritual journeys, and redefine their concept of “home.” Through this, the band successfully reaches out to a struggling generation and offers hope in the melodies.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>","They brought their songs to Jewish people around the world, now they bring them home to you.",,,,,,,,"2015-03-23 00:00:00",,"2014-05-01 00:00:00",,"2014-05-01 00:00:00",,,0,false,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0000,0.0000,0,0.0000,10000.0000,true

<p>Another Yom Kippur had passed; the light of the crisp autumn day had given   way to the chill of a dark, clear night. Elsewhere families had broken their   fast together, but Moishe had gone straight from synagogue services to the   sporting goods store. He wasn't required to work that night, but he was still a   part-time high school student and welcomed the opportunity for an extra three   hours of wages. </p>
<p>Now, waiting for the bus at the end of a very long day, Moishe paused to tuck   the velvet bag containing his <EM>tallis</EM> (prayer shawl) under his arm,   freeing his hand to light a cigarette. Inhaling slowly, he briefly mused over   the synagogue service. The congregation had confessed a litany of sins,   corporate and individual, intentional and unintentional. Then, light-headed, dry   mouthed, stomachs growling from hunger, they'd headed for home or some other   pleasant respite. But had any spiritual transaction actually occurred? </p>
<p>At seventeen, Moishe's awareness of God had grown vague, but his awareness of   himself was sharp enough. He knew that if someone were to draw his spiritual   portrait, sin would certainly be part of the picture....</p>
<p>Glancing around, Moishe noticed that the other person at the bus stop was   dressed in a suit. He appeared to be about twenty years old, had red hair and   was gazing in Moishe's direction. </p>
<p>The stranger looked pointedly at Moishe's shiny shoes, then looked him in the   eye and said, ""You're all dressed up. Are you coming home from work, or a   party?"" His voice was rich and full.... He didn't strike Moishe as being Jewish,   but...it was uncommon to see men dressed in suits, waiting for a bus at   night.</p>
<p>""Work,"" Moishe replied. ""But before that, synagogue."" He usually was not so   open with strangers but it had slipped out before he realized it. He paused,   wondering how the stranger would react to his Jewish identity. [He] looked like   a friendly kind of guy. To Moishe's astonishment, he was more than friendly; he   was downright enthusiastic as he eagerly extended his hand and announced,</p>
<p>""I'm so pleased to meet you! You know, every Jew I meet increases my faith in   God and the Bible.""</p>
<p>""Huh?"" Moishe wondered if he had heard right.</p>
<p>""Well sure. Every living Jew is evidence that the God of the Bible exists and   that He keeps His word.* You know, <A href=""http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Genesis%2012.1-3"" target=""_blank"" lbsReference=""Genesis 12.1-3|NIV"" data-reference=""Genesis 12.1-3"" data-version=""NIV"">Genesis 12:1-3</A>."" Orville proceeded to quote, by heart,   God's promise to Abraham.</p>
<p>Moishe was speechless.</p>
<p>Orville had no problem continuing the conversation. ""Do you go to synagogue   regularly?""</p>
<p>""No, not so much anymore,"" Moishe admitted. ""Today was Yom Kippur. It's a   pretty important holiday for us."" His stomach rumbled. ""Wow, I'm really   hungry.... I haven't really eaten since last night.""</p>
<p>""Really? Are you sick?""</p>
<p>""No, I've been fasting. That's what we do for Yom Kippur. Besides going to   synagogue.""</p>
<p>Orville seemed genuinely interested, ""So what does it all mean?""</p>
<p>Moishe shrugged. ""It means that my sins are supposed to be forgiven."" </p>
<p>""Do you feel your sins are forgiven?""</p>
<p>""Who knows?"" Moishe shrugged, and there was something in his tone of voice   that touched the stranger. </p>
<p>Seeing the bus coming, Moishe crushed the cigarette with his foot. He looked   at Orville and though he thought this guy must be a little nutty, he was still   intrigued by what he'd said about Jews increasing his faith in God and the   Bible. He wasn't quite ready for the conversation to end, so before getting on   the bus he smiled and said, ""I'm Martin Rosen.""</p>
<p>""Orville Freestone,"" the other smiled back. </p>
<p>There was plenty of room on the bus, but the two sat near enough to continue   their discussion. </p>
<p>""I believe there is a way to know that your sins are forgiven,"" Orville   began, and Moishe could tell he was winding up to say more. Then came the pitch:   ""I believe that Christ died for my sins and made it possible for me to know God   and find eternal life.""</p>
<p>This came as no great surprise to Moishe. Since he wasn't Jewish, Moishe   figured he must be Christian. The strangest thing was that as Orville explained   the Christian religion it sounded as though the whole thing was a Jewish idea.   The story of Jesus dying to take the punishment for people's sins, he said, was   pictured in the original observances of Yom Kippur in Bible times, when the   Jewish High Priest placed his hands on the scapegoat and recited the sins of the   people. That goat was then led out into the wilderness, far from the camp of the   Israelites. Another goat was sacrificed and its blood sprinkled on the altar as   an atonement [covering] for sin. It all sounded very weird and spooky, but   Moishe couldn't dismiss it as Christian mumbo-jumbo because clearly Orville was   describing things from the Torah. </p>
<p>Moishe changed the subject, generalizing the topic, taking a philosophical   bent. Orville listened and interacted with Moishe, but now and then he would   mention something from the Bible. </p>
<p>When the bus pulled up to Colfax and Federal Boulevard, it became apparent   that they were getting off at the same stop. ""Well, Orville,"" Moishe said, ""It's   been nice talking to you. But I have to tell you, you've got some one-track   mind. No matter what I say, you bring it back to religion. Look, I don't even   know whether all those things in the Torah happened or not. But even if they   did, it's ancient history. And I'm interested in what goes on today."" </p>
<p>With that, Moishe figured, he'd head north to his home on 15th and Federal,   and Orville, who lived at 14th and Federal would go south. </p>
<p>""Wait a second,"" Orville said. ""You think the Bible doesn't have anything to   do with today? What would you say if I told you that the Bible predicted   something that happened just a little over a year ago?"" </p>
<p>That stopped Moishe in his tracks. Of all the things Orville had said, the   idea that the Bible had something to say about modern life was the most   fascinating. ""What do you mean?""</p>
<p> ""I'm talking about the state of Israel. It's all in the Bible, about how the   Jewish people would return to the Land God promised to Abraham, Isaac and   Jacob.""</p>
<p>Suddenly Moishe found his feet were heading toward Orville's house instead of   his own. The conversation continued as they reached Orville's front   porch....</p>
<p>It was well past midnight when Moishe headed for home, trying not to think   about some of the things he'd heard that night. But some of it was not so easy   to dismiss.... Moishe found himself thinking, ""What Orville says makes sense to   me, and that means I must be one dumb Jew, because Jesus couldn't possibly be   the Messiah. If I were smarter, I'd be able to see why it can't be true."" </p>
<p>It wasn't as though he was particularly interested in God, and he certainly   was not waiting around for the Messiah—so there was really no reason to think   about the discussion any further. As for the New Testament Orville had given   him, Moishe never even thought of reading it. ""If I read it, I might be dumb   enough to believe it, and that would make me one of them [a Christian or   Gentile.] If the rabbis ever get together and decide that Jesus is the Messiah,   maybe I'll go along with them. Until then, I'm not having anything to do with   this book."" </p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a large trashcan outside the tire store next to   Moishe's house. He conveniently dropped the New Testament into it before   climbing the steps to his house. Inside, he quickly undressed and flopped into   bed, utterly exhausted.</p>

<p><span><strong>Volume Two</strong> provides real answers to twenty-eight theological objections many Jewish people raise regarding Christianity. He treats these objections seriously and fairly, building answers from some surprising rabbinic teachings as well as from the Hebrew Scriptures. As Brown's answers progressively demonstrate, belief in Y'shua (Jesus) is not something alien to Jewish tradition but is profoundly rooted in ancient Jewish tradition, fulfilling its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Volume Three</strong> looks specifically at questions raised about messianic prophecies in Isaiah, Daniel, Psalms, Haggai, and Zechariah. It's an invaluable resource for seekers and for anyone wanting to point students of the Torah to Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>In Volume Four</strong>, he addresses questions about issues such as how the New Testament quotes and interprets the Old Testament, the historical accuracy of the New Testament, apparent contradictions in the Gospels and the rest of the New Testament, pagan influences on Christian teachings, and whether Jesus abolished the Torah...</span></p>
<p><span><strong>In Volume Five,</strong> the fifth and final volume of his series, Dr. Michael Brown refutes the traditional Jewish concept that there is a binding, authoritative Oral Law going back to Moses. While showing great respect for his people's traditions, Brown demonstrates that when there is a conflict between the Bible and tradition, Jews are called to follow the Bible.</span></p>

If no one will do anything, she'll have to do it herself.

In 1941 France is still ""free."" But fifteen-year-old Magali is frustrated by the cruel irony of pretending life is normal when food is rationed, new clothes are a rarity, and most of her friends are refugees. And now the government is actually helping the Nazis. Someone has got to do something, but it seems like no one has the guts—until Paquerette arrives.

Smuggling refugee children is Paquerette's job. And she asks Magali to help.

Working with Paquerette is scary and exhausting, but Magali never doubts that it is the right thing to do.

<p></p>
<p></p>
Born of the Holy Land, produced in limited quantities and unparalleled in quality, our artisanal honey is harvested by beekeepers in the best traditions of the region, and one taste can instantly transport you back in time – for this is the land where Jesus spent his childhood, and this is the honey that would have graced his table.
<p></p>
<p></p>
This honey is produced from the nectar of the starthistle, a flower native to the Nazareth Mountains. Starthistle flourishes in the hot, dry summers, and the bees which feed on its nectar produce a monofloral honey that is as unique as the region itself. Honey can be greatly influenced by geography and climate, possessing notes as distinctive for each variety as the notes in wine or olive oil. Our honey is very unique in this manner, with its deep golden color like that of liquid sunshine, a highly aromatic fragrance, and the subtle notes of starthistle in its flavor. An authentic taste of the Holy Land, Nazareth Secret Honey is pure and sweet, with a long, delicate finish and a milder flavor than clover honey.
<p></p>
<p></p>
Honey has been valued since ancient times for its sweet taste and natural health benefits. A unique combination of essential minerals, enzymes, amino acids and proteins, honey is a natural source of energy and is easy for sensitive systems to digest. Honey is naturally anti-microbial and anti-bacterial, and has been used for thousands of years to treat and sooth many illnesses. Consuming honey has been said to help restore vitality and health and can improve mood and combat the effects of aging.

Also illustrates the parallels between the Passover in the Old Testament and the work of Jesus Christ as the perfect Passover lamb in the New Testament.

<p>Matthew 18 - ""BLESSING THE CHILDREN""<p>
<p>At that hour the disciples came to Yeshua, saying, “who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”</p>

<p>2 And He called a child to Himself, set him in the midst of them,</p>

<p>3 and said, “Amen, I tell you, unless you turn and become like children, you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>4 Whoever then shall humble himself like this child, this one is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>5 And whoever welcomes one such child in My name, welcomes Me.</p>

<p>6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who trust in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea!</p>

<p>7 Woe to the world because of snares! For snares must come, but woe to that man through whom the snare comes!”</p>

<p>6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who trust in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea!</p>

<p>Reconciliation is at the heart of each story, though reconciliation in the context of the Middle East is fraught with danger and seemingly impossible challenges. These interviews demonstrate how, despite the tensions and the dreadful headlines, the numbers of believers in Jesus are growing among both Palestinian Muslims and Jews.</p>
<p>Interviewees include expatriate Jews, children of Holocaust survivors, believers from Muslim backgrounds, a former drug addict, a pastor in Bethlehem, and an Egyptian setting up an underground church in Gaza.</p>

<div class=""closeup""><em>The Remnant of Israel: The History, Theology, and Philosophy of the Messianic Jewish Community</em>, is an update on the growing and diversifying community of Jews who have found favor with God by receiving Jesus as Messiah. Written by a Messianic Jew for Jew and Gentile alike, here is an articulate survey of the biblical position of the Messianic Jew in the setting of community. Dr. Fruchtenbaum again assesses how this community is distinctive and how it relates to the Jewish people, the Law of Moses, the local church, the State of Israel, missions, and many other timely topics. The rapid growth of the Messianic Jewish community has provoked interest as well as offense. Here is what is happening in the lives of Messianic Jews and how they and their movement relate their faith to the rest of the world. ◦Paperback: 184 pages</div>

Traditionally the Tallit is the literal fulfillment of the commandment God gave the Jewish people in the Bible, however, the prayer shawl can be used as a means of drawing a worshiper to attention so that they remember the commandments of God and enter into prayer with devotion and intensity.

The original scroll was
inscribed on parchment with spectacular decorations in vivid
color accompanying the text. The area between the columns of
text is decorated brilliantly with flora and fauna motifs.

At the top of each page appears the torso of a man in navy blue and red fez, bespeaking the culture of Persia where the story took
place. Also at the top of each page is a painting of that page's
scene with subtitles and accompanying text. The scenes in the
scroll depict life—culture, clothing, interior design, and food—
as the artist knew it at the beginning of the seventeenth
century.

The ornate case stands 16” tall, and 4 1⁄4” in diameter.

Do Jews need Jesus? It’s an age-old debate with eternal ramifications. If Jesus is not the Jewish Messiah, if He is not the savior of the world, if He is not the promised redeemer God sent to restore Israel and redeem the nations (Isaiah 49:6), then bringing His message to the Jewish people is a grave threat to their security.

But if He is the prophet God promised to raise up, if God did indeed command Israel to follow Him, and if the Jews will be held accountable by God if they don’t accept Jesus, then sharing His message is beyond imperative. Jesus is either “Lord of all or not Lord at all.” The stakes couldn’t be higher.

Jews Don’t Need Jesus… and Other Misconceptions settles this dispute with biblical evidence. It argues that believing in Jesus isn’t apostasy; it’s obedience, and it leads to eternal blessing. That’s what makes this book critical for Jewish people or anyone in gospel ministry to the Jews.

which tells the story of the Moabite woman who decided to cast

Jewish people. As a result she was blessed by Boaz, her

It was Ruth who uttered these immortal words of faith in God: 
“Wherever you go, I shall go. Wherever you live, I shall live. Your

Messianic Prayer Shawl 

Prayer Shawl, Pink acrylic, comes with matching Bag.

Traditionally the Tallit is the literal fulfillment of the commandment God gave the Jewish people in the Bible, however, the prayer shawl can be used as a means of drawing a worshiper to attention so that they remember the commandments of God and enter into prayer with devotion and intensity. 
English: : “Blessed are you O Lord God King of the Universe Who has fulfilled all of the Torah through Yeshua the Messiah and has covered us with His righteousness.” The corners say, “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.”

A trip to the Holy Land is on the bucket list of many Christians. But planning a meaningful trip in a place so filled with significant sites is an imposing task. Most travel guides are not prepared to link the Bible and land in an accurate and meaningful way because they are written for people of all faiths. So how can a Christian traveler prepare a trip that will illuminate God's Word and reveal the Lord's presence? 

In The Holy Land for Christian Travelers, John A. Beck provides a guide to the Holy Land for Christians with explanations of the biblical significance of important sites. The entries provide key Scripture references for reflection and a guide to the land that will encourage communion with God and a genuine spiritual experience for travelers as they walk in the footsteps of Jesus. A trip to the Holy Land can be a worship-filled, once-in-a-lifetime spiritual journey. This book puts a biblical scholar and experienced Holy Land guide at the reader's side.

 This strikingly beautiful Scripture Scroll of Esther is a reproduction of a Megillat Esther created by Moshe Ben Avraham in 1617 in Ferrara, Italy. The original scroll was inscribed on parchment with spectacular decorations in vivid color accompanying the text. The area between the columns of text is decorated brilliantly with flora and fauna motifs. At the top of each page appears the torso of a man in navy blue and red fez, bespeaking the culture of Persia where the story took place. Also at the top of each page is a painting of that page's scene with subtitles and accompanying text. The scenes in the scroll depict life—culture, clothing, interior design, and food— as the artist knew it at the beginning of the seventeenth century.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The Chamber of Last Supper Room is a second-story room in Jerusalem recognized as the ""upper room"" in which Jesus shared the Last Supper with the disciples. This image is a reminder of the life and death of Christ relived each time we celebrate the Eucharist, first given to us by Christ himself within the walls of this chamber.</p>

<p>This image captures the rising of majestic columns before they erupt into scrolls that envelope the entire space. It is considered the site where many other events described in the New Testament took place, including the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples the day of Pentecost and the gathering of the disciples after the Ascension of Jesus.</p>

<p>And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”

<p>The site remained buried until Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and commissioned numerous churches to be built throughout the Holy Land. In the course of the excavations, Constantine's mother St. Helena, is said to have discovered the True Cross near the tomb. It is said she discovered three crosses - those of the two thieves and that of Christ. To discern the one belonging to Christ, a sick man was brought to touch to each one, and he was miraculously healed by one of them.</p>

<p>Constantine's builders dug away the hillside to leave the rock-hewn tomb of Christ isolated and with enough room to built a church around it.</p>
<p>At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.

<p>Jerusalem, Israel-Circa 1900</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The Mount of Olives is a ridge running along the east side of Jerusalem and to this day remains a pilgrimage site in the Holy Land.  It was the location of many events in the Bible. The very location where David wept in defeat and where Jesus was betrayed and rejected, will be the place where Jesus returns in triumph over all His enemies. 
 </p>

<p>Jesus made many visits to this location and after the trials, crucifixion, and resurrection, Jesus once again stood on the Mount of Olives. According to scripture, the prophet Zechariah declared that Jesus will return not only in the same way, but to the same place. This image is a symbol of faith in the return of Jesus..</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>The Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. On that day His feet will stand on the Mount.”
Zechariah 14:3-4</p>

<p>The holy site of Gethsemane is a garden at the foot of the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.

Beside the garden is the Church of All Nations, built over the rock on which Jesus is believed to have prayed. </p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is located in the Old City of Jerusalem and considered the holiest Christian site in the world. It stands on a site between Golgotha and Calvary, believed to be where Jesus was crucified, and the tomb, or sepulchre, where he was buried. </p>

<p>The site remained buried until Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and commissioned numerous churches to be built throughout the Holy Land. In the course of the excavations, Constantine's mother St. Helena, is said to have discovered the True Cross near the tomb. It is said she discovered three crosses - those of the two thieves and that of Christ. To discern the one belonging to Christ, a sick man was brought to touch to each one, and he was miraculously healed by one of them.</p>

<p>Constantine's builders dug away the hillside to leave the rock-hewn tomb of Christ isolated and with enough room to built a church around it.</p>
<p>At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.

Top jazz vocalists and instrumentalists join Joel on his new recording Wondrous Love, which features worshipful gospel-jazz arrangements of traditional Jewish liturgical songs, hymns, contemporary Christian songs and originals. A new, refreshing way to enjoy some of your favorite worship songs and a great way to share the gospel of Yeshua with friends and relatives!

    This CD is the culmination of many years of prayer, and features many of Joel's original compositions and arrangements written for jazz ensemble and vocalists. 
    Joel has served as pianist at several churches and Messianic congregations in the New York City including The Brooklyn Tabernacle, Congregation Beit Hofesh and most recently, Congregation Shaar Adonai, and has also served at several Jews for Jesus ingatherings, as well as High Holy day services. 
    His desire is to meld the rich genres of Messianic, Gospel and Jazz music in a way that they can reach as many people as possible, both Jew and Gentile, with the life-changing message that Yeshua is indeed the Messiah!

<p>Description</p>
<p>Jacob’s Well is located in the West Bank and is often considered the most authentic site in the Holy Land, since no one can move a well.  It is the site where Jesus asked a Samaritan woman for a drink while He was resting after a tiring journey.  In speaking with a Samaritan and, even more shocking, a woman, and asking her for a drink, He was breaking all cultural taboos. Because of her positive response, however, He introduced her to living waters and a new life in communion with Him.</p>

<p>In this world of sin and division, no holy site more explicitly represents the love and acceptance that Jesus asks us all to have toward one another, regardless of our beginnings or differences.  He asks this of us and in return offers us “living waters”..</p>

<p>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
John 4:14</p>

Jesus called them, and immediately they left their nets to follow him. .</p>

Tikkun Olam is Hebrew for “repair of the world”—making the world a better place. For Jewish people, it’s an essential obligation alongside honor for parents, giving to charity and many more. In this treasure of a book, author Richard A. Robinson tours the reader through seven Jewish core values from the Old Testament, on through Jewish tradition, and then on into the New Testament. Through a rich assortment of anecdotes, timely illustrations and a dose of Jewish humor, Robinson shows how Jesus embodied these ethical values—and how the ultimate day He “repaired the world” was the day He died for our sins. Written with your Jewish friends and relatives in mind, this delightful volume will be sure to enhance your own understanding of the New Testament as well!

This year we’re whitewater rafting on the Klamath River near the Oregon border, and it's an amazing amount of fun! We'll start at a ranch in Oroville (near Chico) and end in San Francisco. In between will be a road trip, rafting on a beautiful river, sleeping where you can see more stars than you can imagine, and on our drive back to San Francisco we’ll pass through the Avenue of the Giants (the coast redwoods). Adventure camp is designed to foster community among our campers and staff as we dig deeper into God’s Word together. Surrounded by the beauty of His creation, we seek to grow closer to the Lord and each other. ","Whitewater Rafting
